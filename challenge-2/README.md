            *Speed Detector*
   *Overview*
The Speed Detector is a simple JavaScript program that checks a car's speed and helps determine if the driver is exceeding the speed limit. It calculates demerit points and alerts the user if the license is at risk of being suspended.

   *Usage*
1.Run the Program: Use Node.js to run the program. Open your terminal and enter the command:
          Copy code :  (node speed-detector.js)
2.Input Car's Speed: The program will prompt you to enter the car's speed in km/h. Type in the speed and press Enter.

3.View the Result: The program will display:

-"Ok" if the car is within the speed limit.
-"Points: X" if the car is speeding, where X is the number of demerit points.
-"License suspended" if 12 or more demerit points are accumulated.
  *Example*
Input: Car's speed: 85 km/h
Output: "Points: 3" (3 demerit points for exceeding the speed limit)
