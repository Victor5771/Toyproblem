*Student Grade Calculator*
    *Introduction*
Welcome to the Student Grade Calculator! This is a simple program that helps you figure out what grade a student gets based on their test score. It's  a tool that tells you if you did great or need a bit more practice.

      *How to Use*
-Open the Program: You can use this program in two ways:

a)If you're on a website or in a coding playground, just paste the code there.
b)If you have a special coding tool called Node.js, save the code as a file with a .js extension and run it in your terminal.
-Enter the Score: The program will ask you to type in the student's score. Just type a number between 0 and 100.

-See the Grade: Once you type the score, the program will show you what grade the student gets. It will be one of these: A, B, C, D, or E.

Example
Let's say you type in 75, which is a pretty good score. The program will tell you: "Student's grade: B."

Troubleshooting
If you type something that's not a number, the program will say, "Invalid input. Marks should be between 0 and 100."
If you type a number outside the range of 0 to 100, it will also say, "Invalid input."
